# Tile-Puzzle

## This is a project in "Problem solving through search" Course

the goal is to find the shortest solution to a given tile puzzle problem within the next algorithms:

### BFS, DFS, A*, IDA*, DFBnB

Applied a Heuristic-function in several algorithms to improve the outcome and open-list/closed-list to avoid duplicates
