# Tile-Puzzle

## This is a project in "Problem solving through search" Course

the goal is to find the shortest solution to a given tile puzzle problem within the next algorithms:

### BFS, DFS, A*, IDA*, DFBnB

Applied a Heuristic-function in several algorithms to improve the outcome and open-list/closed-list to avoid duplicates

## Examples: 

### input:

explanation by rows : 
* the algorithm which we use
* if we want to measure the time of the proccess
* if we want to output the open-list content to the output file
* the size of our tile puzzle
* if we have special black cubes it will be writen here
* if we have special red cubes it will be writen here
* the next rows from here stand for the puzzle itself.

### output:

explanation by rows : 
* the order of the steps we need to go for the puzzle to be solved
* number of children need to be made to the puzzle for the solution
* cost is related to the move cost regarding the color.
### open-list content by each step:
